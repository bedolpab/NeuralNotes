# NeuralNotes Repository

## Overview

**NeuralNotes** is a personal and academic archive created in preparation for graduate-level study in **quantum computing** and **cryptography**. It contains both formal coursework and self-directed learning with handwritten notes (scanned via *Microsoft Lens*), written code, and notebooks.

## Purpose

1. Document my progress and preparation for advanced study.
2. Combine analog (handwritten) and digital (code, notebooks) learning artifacts.
3. Learning of foundational topics in cryptography and quantum computing.

## Structure
